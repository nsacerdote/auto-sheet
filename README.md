# AutoSheet
Simple library that accepts `xls` files, applies the transformations you want to them and it returns a `csv` file with the result.

It works in the browser and node.

## Why
I was tired of repeating the same boring steps with the `xls` files my banks provide.
I only needed some columns, with different names and as `csv`. (I use [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) to track my spending).

## Install
`npm install auto-sheet`

## Examples
See /examples folder
